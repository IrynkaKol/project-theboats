          <h2>What we do:</h2>
          <p>
            Our team of IPM Inspectors makes regular physical visits to your
            marina, ensuring your boat is safe and well cared for. We provide
            you with comprehensive photo and video reports, capturing every
            conceivable angle, from the mast to the deck, assessing the
            condition of fenders, offering a general overview, and providing
            insights into the surrounding environment. Importantly, we respect
            your privacy and do not interfere with onboard electronic monitoring
            systems, CCTV, or the like.

          <h2>How we do it:</h2>
          <p>
            We operate exclusively under a Power of Attorney and are strictly
            limited to monitoring activities. Rest assured, we never set foot on
            your boat. Instead, we maintain our watchful eye from the pontoon or
            pier. To facilitate our access, we will coordinate with your marina,
            ensuring they are aware of our authorized status, and provide them
            with the necessary Power of Attorney documentation. Let us emphasize
            once more; we do not board your boat.
